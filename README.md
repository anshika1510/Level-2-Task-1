# Level-2-Task-1

**Responsive Card and Grid Layout**
This project showcases a responsive card component with an image and text, along with a basic responsive grid layout.
Although the task suggested using front-end frameworks like Bulma, UIKit, Bootstrap, or Foundation, this project is built purely with HTML and CSS without relying on any external front-end libraries.

**Features**
✅ Responsive card design with image and text

✅ Mobile-first approach

✅ Flexible and scalable grid layout
